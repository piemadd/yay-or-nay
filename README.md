# Yay || Nay

## About (IG)
Are you tired of saying Yes or No a lot while back to school shopping with your parent/legal guardian? Why not have a website where all you need to do is press a button? Its so simple, even a bird could do it!

## IDK
While walking through a Target in Chicago and getting ready for my first year at IIT, I thought to myself that I was saying "Yes" or "No" a lot to my mom. But, as a programmer, I felt this was a task that would 100% benefit from being automated, which is why I made this simple yet elegant website. It just works.
